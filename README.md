1. Information We Do Not Collect
We are committed to protecting your privacy. XR Pollinators is designed with a strict "no data collection" policy:

No Personal Information: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information about you, such as your name, email address, location, device identifiers, or any other personally identifiable data.

No Usage Data or Analytics: We do not collect any usage data, analytics, crash reports, or performance metrics from your gameplay or device. There are no third-party analytics tools integrated into the Game.

No Information Sharing: Since we do not collect any information, we do not share any information with third parties.

2. Permissions and Device Access
To function, XR Pollinators requires specific permissions on your device. These permissions are used solely for the intended functionality of the Game and do not involve data collection by us.

Camera Access: The Game requires access to your device's camera. This access is essential for the Augmented Reality (AR) features of XR Pollinators, allowing the game to overlay digital content onto your real-world environment. The camera feed is processed locally on your device and is not accessed, stored, or transmitted by us.

3. Children's Privacy
XR Pollinators is intended for general audiences. As we do not collect any personal information from any users, our practices are consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other similar regulations.
