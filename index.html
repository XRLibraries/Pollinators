        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="mb-4">This Privacy Policy describes how John Macleod ("we," "us," or "our") handles information for the mobile game "XR Pollinators" (the "Game"), developed using Unreal Engine 5.</p>

        <!-- Section 1: Information We Do Not Collect -->
        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">We are committed to protecting your privacy. XR Pollinators is designed with a strict "no data collection" policy:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information about you, such as your name, email address, location, device identifiers, or any other personally identifiable data.</li>
            <li><strong>No Usage Data or Analytics:</strong> We do not collect any usage data, analytics, crash reports, or performance metrics from your gameplay or device. There are no third-party analytics tools integrated into the Game.</li>
            <li><strong>No Information Sharing:</strong> Since we do not collect any information, we do not share any information with third parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Section 2: Permissions and Device Access -->
        <h2>2. Permissions and Device Access</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">To function, XR Pollinators requires specific permissions on your device. These permissions are used solely for the intended functionality of the Game and do not involve data collection by us.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The Game requires access to your device's camera. This access is <strong>essential for the Augmented Reality (AR) features</strong> of XR Pollinators, allowing the game to overlay digital content onto your real-world environment. The camera feed is processed locally on your device and is not accessed, stored, or transmitted by us.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Access (Photos/Media/Files or Screenshots Folder):</strong> The Game may request access to your device's storage. This permission is specifically used to <strong>write data to disk, such as saving screenshots</strong> that you choose to take within the Game. We do not access, read, or transmit any other files from your storage.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Section 3: Children's Privacy -->
        <h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">XR Pollinators is intended for general audiences. As we do not collect any personal information from any users, our practices are consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other similar regulations.</p>

        <!-- Section 4: Changes to This Privacy Policy -->
        <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Game or on a relevant website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <!-- Section 5: Contact Us -->
        <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact John Macleod directly via the contact information provided where you obtained the Game or through official channels related to the Game's distribution.</p>
